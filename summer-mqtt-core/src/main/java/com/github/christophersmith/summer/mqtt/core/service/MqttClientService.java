 * While the actual MQTT Client implementation delves in the specifics, this interface defines the
 * contracts that are available. The specific features this interface define are:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Connection information and state reporting</li>
 * <li>Starting, stopping and closing the underlying MQTT Client connection</li>
 * <li>Subscribing and unsubscribing from Topic Filters</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * For implementations that are configured for receiving in-bound messages, those messages should be
 * sent to an in-bound {@link MessageChannel}. An application provided {@link MessageHandler} would
 * then receive that message and process.
 * <p>
 * For implementations that are configured for sending out-bound messages and are subscribed to an
 * out-bound {@link MessageChannel}, those messages should be published via the implementation's
 * MQTT Client.
